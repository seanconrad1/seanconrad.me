    <p>
      Full stack web developer with a passion for building and critical thinking.
      With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a background in
      desktop support, I discovered web development and programming through
      wanting to know how video games were created. I bring strong skills in
      problem solving and troubleshooting that help creating solutions and
      fixing problems as well as a drive to want to learn and teach myself new
      skills.
